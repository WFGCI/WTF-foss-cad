### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Why does this group exist?
According to Mussy, the reason this group exists is for R&D and to help each other. However, if you have little to no experience in firearms this becomes very dangerous and we do not want others to get hurt because of our designs. Please be respectful of our time and try and answer questions on your own first as it gets tiresome to answer the same questions over and over again. Or to put it another way from SG2020:
```
Ok, (read this with captain jack Sparrow in mind) if someone asks a question and an answerer answers the question could the asker read and apply the answerers answer. That would ensure that the answerer doesn't get frustrated by the asker and the asker doesn't think that the answerer didn't answer the askers question. 
```

#### How do I get into the DEV groups?
This was a change from how things worked in Keybase; the DEV groups are invite-only now. If you want to get in, contribute, design something cool and share it here, and someone will invite you to join. If it helps, they’re usually quiet for weeks at a time, so you’re not missing as much as you think.

#### Where to start?
The mod9v2 has the best documentation and community support. The Mod9v3 has more features, but will take more skill to build. If you are just getting started, try the V2.
The v2 is the easiest starting point because the v3 bolt is more difficult to fabricate

#### What materials should we print in?
PLA+ -> ABS/ASA -> Glass/Fiber-Filled Nylon
These are ranked by effectiveness, but also barrier for entry. Start with what your skill/equipment allows and be aware of the limitations of the material. Know that anything besides PLA+ will put out  fumes of various levels of danger, and that you will need an enclosure and possibly ventilation.

#### What's wrong with PETG?
It's fine for objects that need heat resistance or UV stability, but aren't shock loaded. Guns are just one use case that doesn't pair well with it. 
PETG has strain rate related failure modes. It deforms under constant force, but shatters under impact. This tendency to fail all at once as opposed to failing safely, makes it less good for an explosion-powered machine you hold near your face. PLA+ has has up to twice the impact strength and fails by breaking instead of shattering.

#### Where do I get the files?
This repo is an attempt to collect all the files from various parts of the internet and make them easily available. If you want to add to this repo please provide a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

The files are organized by types and then versions and related files. Each sub folder will have a README that explains about the project and if it has been replaced by newer projects.

Example of directory structure:
``` WTF-FOSS-CAD
├───MOD-22 
├───MOD-9 
│   ├───Version 2 
│   └───Version 3 
├───MX-22 
└───WTF-9 
```

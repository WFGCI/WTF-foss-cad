### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
#### What spring do I need?
1.4 mm wire, 12mm outside Diameter (OD), cut to no shorter than 7.5 inches(190.5mm). Start at 8 inches (203.2mm) and adjust as needed. This is the only spring that is needed. If you are following guides that talk about an RC shock, they are old and that should be ignored. This spring powers the charging handle as well as returning the bolt.

While others may work there are many factors that go into determining if a spring will work correctly (spring rate). If you are unsure, ask on the chat (Memphistopheles is the resident expert).

#### Where is the instruction guide?
The instruction guide is still being created. In the mean time you may follow the [Version 2 assembly guide](https://github.com/jscancella/WTF-foss-cad/blob/master/MOD-9/Version%202/MOD9V2-Intstructions_%26_Guides/MOD9V1_Assembly_Suggestions_07.22.2020.pdf) and common logic for what has changed.

#### What do I do for the extractor?
Many things have been tried but what seems to work the best is either a big bobble pin or windshield wiper spring bent in a gentle 90 degrees.
An example is:

#### Can I use a glock 19 barrel?
The Glock 19 Gen 3 uses different lugs than the Gen 3 Glock 17. The Gen 5 Glock 19 and 17 use the same lugs so you can use the v3 Customizer with the Gen 5 option to have a proper recess for the Glock 19.

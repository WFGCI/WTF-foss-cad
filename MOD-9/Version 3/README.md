### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
#### What spring do I need?
1.4 mm wire, 12mm outside Diameter (OD), cut to no shorter than 7.5 inches(190.5mm). Start at 8 inches (203.2mm) and adjust as needed. This is the only spring that is needed. If you are following guides that talk about an RC shock, they are old and that should be ignored. This spring powers the charging handle as well as returning the bolt.

#### What do I do for the extractor
Many things have been tried but what seems to work the best is either a big bobble pin or windshield wiper spring bent in a gentle 90 degrees.

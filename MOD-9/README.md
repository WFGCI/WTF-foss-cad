# Mod-9 semi-auto pistol

### Which version should I choose?
#### [Version 2](Version%202)
This version has a much easier DIY bolt. If this is your first DIY firearm, start here as it has been more throughly documented and is generally easier to make.

#### [Version 3](Version%203)
This version has more features, but the bolt is harder to manufacter. Only build this one if you have good metalworking and critical thinking skills as you will need to figure out how things go together and make your own solutions in some cases.

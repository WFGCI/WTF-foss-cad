## Main differences from MOD9 version 1
* mag angle is different. 3 degrees counter clockwise to assist in feeding
* upper has cutouts for a retractable stock and alignment lugs
* retrackable wire stock, and new alignment rods (new endcap made for this)
* lower bolt and firing pin shortened by 5mm(both receivers, bolt carrier, ejector mount, and ejector have been shortened accordingly)
* bolt carrier spring hole has been moved. it was offset slightly
* it can accept the Walther p38 firing pin now (make firing pin hole bigger or modify firing pin to fit the spec)
* firing pin exit hole made smaller to stop over penetration of primer and primer blowout
* Ejector moved forward 4mm

## ** What is the MOD9V2? **
The MOD9V2 is a semi-automatic, 3D printed and DIYable 9mm Luger Pistol Caliber Carbine (PCC). It is constructed using 3D printed components, easily-obtainable hardware store fasteners, a DIY-style steel bolt, 
(cont.) as well as a few firearm components (G17, SW9VE, & RP9 barrels, Glock magazine, AK-47 recoil spring, and AR-15 FCG), 
(cont)or alternatively use none firearms components (ECM barrel, 3D printed Glock magazine, compression spring as a recoil spring, and 3D printed AR-15 FCG.)
It is developed to be the most advanced and capable 3D printed and DIYable semi-automatic 9mm Luger Pistol Calber Carbine(PCC) at the time it was developed and initially released.
The MOD9V2 is a modular platform that comes with several different parts, such as multiple barrel retainers and handguards, braces, foregrips, grips, magwells, upper receivers, stocks, and most importantly has a dedicated community continually designing more parts, upgrades, and accessories.

### Recoil Spring:
  	*Message from Derwood, "I highly recommend the longer recoil spring version (MOD9V2_Retrack_Wire_Endcap_Extendened_FINAL). The recoil is super soft. It beats out the Ruger PC Charger on recoil."
   Recoil spring for "MOD9V2_Extended_Endcap" and "MOD9V2_Retrack_Wire_Endcap_Extendened_FINAL_27_MAR_2021".
    - These endcaps do NOT use a secondary buffer spring or hydraulic buffer. Only install the recoil spring.
	(1) Compression Spring: 1.4mm WD x 12mm OD x 300mm long; cut spring length between 9.5in[241mm] to 8.5in[203mm] long.
	    Note: If bolt does not go all the way back when function checking, trim the recoil spring by 0.5in[13mm], and then try function testing again.
        ALTERNATIVE, Compression Spring [McMaster part# 9637K83]
   OR
   Recoil spring for "MOD9V2_Scorpion_Endcap(2ndary spring)_byIMA"
	- This endcap DOES use a secondary buffer spring. Refer to the "CZ Scorpion OEM or Skeleton Brace Endcap & Parts" for parts recomendations.
	(1) AK-47 Recoil Spring. Cut spring length to 7.5ins[190.5mm] long.
		 Note 1: It is highly recommended to NOT use AK-47 recoil springs with **dead links**. Those dead links change the bolts timing, and may not allow the bolt to travel all the way back.
	     - If using AK-47 recoil spring with dead links, cut length to 7in[241mm].

## ** Function Check: **
  Do NOT load the firearm at any time when function checking the firearm. Do NOT have live ammunition near the workspace when function checking.

  Fire Control Group(FCG) Safety: 
   This check is to confirm that there the FCG safety is functioning as normal. If the safety fails either of these 2 test that is a no-go. If it fails take remedial action.
   Check the lower receiver without attaching it to the upper receiver installed. Visually watch the parts to confirm function.
  - FCG safety should click into place into the “SAFE” and “FIRE” positions.
  - FCG hammer should not release when the trigger is pulled while the safety is in the “SAFE” position.

  Charging Handle and Ejector movement:
   This check is to confirm that there is no issue with the charging handle and ejector moving freely moving when installed in the upper receiver. If there is drag or something catching, take remedial action.
   Check with the completed lower receiver, completed upper receiver, and completed endcap attached together.
  - Charging handle should move smoothly all the way back and forth without catching on anything, or it stopping unless it has bottomed out.
  - Ejector should move freely with minimum wiggle in the ejector slot when the bolt passes it.

  Barrel Seating/Headspacing in Upper Receiver and Barrel Retainer:
   This check is to confirm that there is no issue with how the barrel retainer is holding the barrel in the upper receiver, otherwise called the headspacing. If the barrel moves out that is no-go, there is a issue with how the barrel retainer and upper are attached. If it fails take remedial action.
   Check with the completed lower receiver, completed upper receiver, and completed endcap attached together.
   - Charge the firearm rapidly, allowing the bolt to slam home each, a couple (4-5) times. Check if the top part of the barrel is still protruding from the upper into the chamber.
     (Cont.) Let the bolt slam home a couple of times and see if the top part of the barrel still protrudes into the chamber of the upper

  Magazine Catch/Release and Magazinewell:
   This check is to confirm that there is no issue with the magazine catch/release fully engaging the notch on the magazine, and that the magazine freely moves in and out of the magazinewell.
   Check the magazine catch/release with it installed in the magazinewell, but without attaching it to lower receiver.
  - Insert the magazine with different amounts of force a couple(5-6) times into the magazinewell. Each time check that the magazine stays in place when:  trying to remove the magazine without pressing the catch/release and shaking the magazinewell without holding the magazine or pushing the catch/release.
    (Cont.) Each time, check that the magazine freely comes out when the catch/release is fully pushed.

  Lower Bolt Firing Pin Hole Alignment:
   This check is to confirm that the firing pin hole in the lower bolt and the firing pin are in alignment to hit near the center of the primer on the cartridge. If the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge or is very off center, take remedial action or replace the bolt.
   Check with the completed lower receiver, completed upper receiver, and completed endcap attached together.
   For this check you will need a inert 9mm Luger round. Use either a snap cap(works best), spent shell casing with a used primer, or a 3D printed 9mm Luger cartridge.
  1.Place the inert round into the chamber.
  2.Place a piece of paper over the end of the chambered inert round.
  3.Fold or mark the paper to show how it is aligned in the chamber.
  4.Follow the 4 rules of firearms safety. Charge the firearm, and allow the bolt slam home.
  5.Follow the 4 rules of firearms safety. Put the safety into the “FIRE” position, and pull the trigger.
  6.Check if the firing pin hit near the center of the primer. Look at the piece of paper, and check if the firing pin hole in the piece of paper is aligned with the dent on the primer.

  Firing Pin Test guide by v555:
   Please read "Function_Check-Firing_Pin_Test_byv555" in the "Instructions & Guides" folder.

## ** Trouble Shooting: **
  - Hole drilled too big when drilling out the holes, or drillbit got too hot and melted into the polymer.
    Possible Solutions(in no particular order):
     1. Use a bigger screw that fits in the hole.
     2. Use a threaded insert.
     3. Plastic weld the hole with the excess plastic drilled out, and redrill the hole to the right size.
     4. Reprint that part.

  - Screws not going in after drilling out the holes. 
    - Maybe try drill out the holes again with a slightly larger drill bit and try screwing them in again.
	- Maybe try to preheat your screws to 80*C, and try screwing them in.
	- Maybe try to use black hardened screws, and force the screws in.

  - Threads in the hand grip screw hole in the lower receiver are stripped.
    - You install a helicoil in the hole, and then screw if back in.
	- You can install a heated brass insert in the hole, and then screw if back in.
    - You can grease the screw and epoxy it into place.
    - You can skip screwing the grip. Epoxy the grip to the lower receiver.

  - My firing pin function check fails
    - Firing pin not hitting at all, or it is lightly dimpled.
	  - Fire control group(FCG) Hammer spring may be installed backwards. Refer to "AR-15 Hammer Spring Orientation.png" picture in "Instructions & Guides" folder. 
      - Check that the firing pin is not jammed in the firing pin hole.
      - Check the length of the firing pin, and compare it to the technical drawings.
      - Check if the barrel is seated properly in the upper receiver Check if it is not pressed all the way in.
      - Check if the firing pin spring is too long, or not straight.
    - Firing pin not hitting the center of the primer.
	  - Firing pin hole in lower bolt was not drilled straight.
      - Lower bolt could be too low. It could have partially separated while welding.
      - Offset from center, the two bolt pieces were not aligned while welding.
      - You sanded the bottom of the bolt housing to fit the bolt. (unless it is hitting high then sanding the bottom will lower it slightly).

  - Primers blow out, or primer bulge after firing.
    Please read "MOD9-Trouble_Shooting-primer_bulge.txt" in the "Instructions & Guides" folder.
    - Firing pin is too long.
	- Firing pin is too pointy.
    - The hole for the firing pin in the lower bolt is too big and it.


## ** FAQ: **
  - Can I rapid fire the MOD9V2? Will the MOD9V2 melt when I shoot it? I don't think it will last more than a mag.
   Yes, you can rapid fire the MOD9V2, but we highly recomende against for longgevity of the firearm.
   No, the MOD9V2 will not melt. The barrel doesn't get hot like a AR-15 in acouple mags to be a big problem. 
   From Mussy, "They will all melt the barrel retainer if you shoot 150 rds rapidly , you must allow the gun to cool between mags. Anything less then 150rds is good. This is desgined that way."
  
  - The MOD9 doesn't use un-regulated firearms parts?, The MOD9 is only meant to be made in the USA?, etc...
   That is a very narrow way to judge this design, and is perpetuated by misinformation. Especially by people that have not looked at all the MOD9 CAD files, the documentation, or reached out to the Weight Forward community for help.
   Imagination will help oneself adapt to their situation and with their resources. Strictly limiting oneself because something is not explicitly stated in documentation is to that person's loss.
   The MOD9 can take ECM barrels, can use both metric and imperial screws, bolts, nuts, etc..., has a lower that was developed for unregulated airsoft fire control groups(FCG), and uses normal compression springs for the recoil and dampening springs.
   With this knowledge, the MOD9 is no less capable of being made with un-regulated firearms parts than the FGC-9.
   The MOD9's emphasis on convenience for American builders does not invalidate its capability of being made by European builders. The MOD9 can be adpated to any situation that the builder is in.
   The simplicity of the MOD9 and the non-printed parts it uses ensures that those non-printed parts are commonly available, or can easily substituted if the need be.
   It is a forgiving designed firearm that is can function without requiring it to be made strictly following the docuementation/guides.
  
  - Why is the MOD9V2 bolt complicated compared to the FGC-9(based on the AP9 bolt)?
   It is no more complicated than other bolts it is compared to. The MOD9V2 bolt does not need to be threaded for a charging handle like the FGC-9 bolt.
   The MOD9V2 at the time of its developement was meant to be the most adavnced 3D printable and DIYable firearm when it was released, while still being able to easily be made by most people.
   The MOD9V2 was designed to be a modern firearm. The main developement criteria was to have a modular firearm, be smooth recoiling when fired, to be portable, and easily made with commonly available tools and parts by the average person.
   The majority of the bolt weight being over the barrel is used similarly to great effect in current modern production firearms.
   The MOD9V2 may take more time in comparison to make for beginners since making the MOD9V2 bolt from hardware store parts will take more time becuase their would be more welding involved welding and cutting the bolt to shape. 
   The MOD9V2 bolt can be made with all the parts from a hardware store. 
   
  - Are you guys gonna make a better guide? Are you guys gonna update the current documentation?
   Yes, we are working on completing guide and bill of materials (BOM), but we currently backed up with catching up on everything after Keybase purged our group unexpectedly, and shifting to new focuses and developements.\
   Yes, we recognize their are inconsistencies and mismatched info between documentation, and that some docuementation uses information for the MOD9V1 instead of the MOD9V2. Those docuements are included for references, while we work on updating all the docuementation. Those documents specs can however easily be adpated to the MOD9V2.
   We are also working on updating the "MOD9V2_Parts_List_&_Assembly_Guide(NOV2020).pdf" with the most current specs.
  
  - Are you going to make docuementation for the P-Rail stocks and braces?
   Yes, we are working on it, but for other developements have taken prescedence over them for the moment. We will also work on having the files in the most optimal print orientation.
   A brief explanation of how to secure it to the picatinny rail endcap is to drill and hammer in a pin. Should be a pretty snug fit.
  
  - Are you guys working on a Glock 19 Gen 1-5 / Glock 17 Gen 5 upper reciver and barrel retainer?
   Yes. They was not a prominet amount of people asking, so it was not made. Also, Glock barrels for several months where practically unavailable to test with.
  
  - Are you guys working on a Weldless Bolt design? Is their a home machine so I can make the bolt at home to make bolts?
   Yes. We are working on adpating and testing Lulzgoat's "Goat Bolt" to the MOD9V2. Ghostsnake's MOD9 Angle Grinder Latheless Optional Weld (AGLOW) bolt that is Inspired by Brolatariot's TWAT design for a threaded weldless alternative since its the same general concept.
   Yes, Mussy has designed a 3D printable mini desktop lathe and slot cutter. Their is no docuementation for building a bolt with it, so it is not advised for the faint of heart.
   
  - What is the difference between the all the various MOD9s? Parts compatibility?
   Originally the versions in the name meant that there was a noteworthy improvement, but now version more means generations, as each version has its own unique features that separates themselves. To use an analogy, think how Glock has various generations of the same firearms. Fundamentally the same idea, but different. 
   The MOD9V3 does not directly replace the MOD9V2, because the MOD9V3 bolt is not meant to be as easily DIYable like the MOD9V2 bolt. The MOD9V3 bolt was meant to be the most advanced DIYable at the time it was released. That is why the MOD9V3 bolt has a internal extractor and ejector.
   The MOD9V2 though, is a direct replacement for the MOD9V1. It has several updates and upgrades noted below in the changelog.
   It should be noted even though many parts are interchangeable between versions, it is highly recommended to not interchange parts between versions. Exception applies to the magwell and etc… If you interchange parts between versions you accept the responsibility.

  - Allen wrenches or keys (only needed IF using hex heads screws)

Tools needed to make bolt:
  - Caliper or Micrometer
  - Tape measure (Metric and/or Imperial measurements)
  - Semi round and flat metal file (deburring and/or flatening rod ends)
  - Angle Grinder (used for the cutting operation)
  - C-Clamps (optional - clamp lathe assembly securely to table/workbench)


Print Recomendations settings: for PLA+ on Cura Slicer (Ver 4.8)
  Recomended to print parts in PLA+, because of sparks that could melt regular PLA.
  *BEFORE* you start printing any part. Confirm you 3D printer is properly calibrated following this guide https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html
  Level you 3D printers buildplate/bed before printing big parts.
  Build plate/bed printing preparation use gluestick or hairspray, or optionally print on top of Kapton/painters tape.
  Before modifying any of the settings below, it is recommend you start with the default "Standard Quality - 0.2mm" profile.
  Change your viewable print settings from basic to advanced. Without changing the viewable print settings you will not be able to change some of the settings below.
  - Print Orientation           - As it is when loaded in the slicer
  - Quality: Layer Height       - 0.2mm
  - Quality: Line Width         - By default is 0.4mm. (Strongly recommended as bigger nozzles will lose some detail, and may cause issues.)
  - Shell: Wall Thickness       - 2.8mm when using 0.4mm line width, 6 wall line count
  - Shell: Top/Bottom Thickness - By default is 1mm when using 0.2mm layer height, 5 top layers, 5 bottom layers
  - Infill: Infill Density      - 20%
  - Infill: Infill Pattern      - Lines or Grid
  - Material: Print Temp        - PLA+: 225-230*C
  - Material: Build Plate Temp  - 60*C
  - Cooling: Fan Speed          - 30% (Low cooling is better for layer adhesion)
  - BuildPlate Adhession        - Brim (Recommended, but not required)
  - Supports: These parts are designed and orientated to be printed with NO supports.

Print Recomendations settings: for PLA+ on PrusaSlicer (Ver 2.3.0)
  Recomended to print parts in PLA+, because of sparks that could melt regular PLA.
  *BEFORE* you start printing any part. Confirm you 3D printer is properly calibrated following this guide https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html
  Level you 3D printers buildplate/bed before printing big parts.
  Build plate/bed printing preparation use gluestick or hairspray, or optionally print on top of Kapton/painters tape.

    - Fan speed:                 - Min: 30%


Assembly Notes(abridged):
  Assembly the lathe by slotting in pieces to their corresponding dovetail, and then instal screws or bolts to secure parts together.
  No pre-drill required. Simply screw in screws, or install brass heat set inserts then screw in the screws.


Operation Instructions(abridged):
  This lathe operates under the same principleas a normal lathe, but uses a different setup and tools to reach the same end goal.
  Watch videos on how lathes work to get a general idea of how to adpat how that translates to this (like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Dnmd3lDzA&list=PLY67-4BrEae9Ad91LPRIhcLJM9fO-HJyN).
  
  To use this lathe, insert rod in between bearings, mark cutting area with marker,
  (cont.) gently move angle grinder blade across the intended cutting area back and forth a couple passes, then measure and then mark cutting area again,
  (cont.) and then repeat the cutting and measuring and marking operation until finished.

  Changelog - Documentation - 04/23/2021 Update:
   Added documentation (README.txt)
   Exported parts from .stp file, and orientated parts for optimal print orientation
   Added to MOD9V2 Megapack

Notes:
  The 3D printable files(.stl) are exported from the CAD files(stp), in Deisgn Spark Mechanical, at a resolution of 0.3mm & 3*(degrees), then the objects where oriented to the optimal print orientation in Cura Slicer, and then exported as 3mf files in Cura Slicer.
  Detailed explanation by Prusa Research on why to go with the .3mf file format for 3D printing. https://blog.prusaprinters.org/3mf-file-format-and-why-its-great_30986/

Hi, this is instructions for ghostsnake's easy Mod9 and WTF bolt based on Brolatariot's TWAT concept

BOM:
3/4-11 threaded rod (XX mm, XX inches)
3/4-11 nuts (larger 54 gram nuts prefered, check CAD model for max size)
2 1/4 Duplex nial firing pin or longer, ink pen spring that fits over the nail
metal plate for front plate (I was going to test 1.5mm sheet metal to stress test it, stronger material would be good and let me know what works/fails)
printed bolt carrier
printed bottom bolt check jig

Instructions:
If you have a vice put 2 nuts on the threaded rod to lock it, then clamp in vice (you can also clamp on one side since you will be grinding off that portion of threads)
Mark at these lengths XX, XX, XX and you can either cut it to upper bolt length now or later (longest mark)
Except for the middle area (leave those threads), grind to depth of where the thread cuts stop (this makes it an easy uniform gauge), spin bolt in vice as needed
The end chamfer is on the short side, its angle is aproximate and its length is XX length wise

Lower bolt length is XX
I find it easiest to do the grinding with it still uncut from the reast of the threaded bar stock for easier clamping, you basically grind to the halfway mark so this takes a while and cool it with water as needed
Use printed check gauge to ensure its depth is far enough and its cut length will be flush with check tool (you can also perform the finishing grinds witth it in this tool for convenenicne, though the tool will melt)

faceplate:
Cut to cad dimensions with hacksaw
for thin sheet metal you can fold tab with either plairs or hammer it in vice (thinckness of metal will vary where to bend)
drill firing pin hole with XXmm/XXin bit
if you have a welder I recomend drilling 3 to 4 small holes in it to tack weld it to lower bolt (have lower bolt assembled in bolt carrier with the top threaded rod inserted, this is critical for ensuring its depth is correct, if the lower bolt is sticking out some grind down it down just a little to ensure flush with bottom of faceplate indent)
if you don't have a welder you can try using countersink screws or high strength epoxy (it might be possible to make the plate a little wider and screw the screws into there but I had a welder so ideas are welcome and my FreeCAD files for modification will be available for anyone to modify)


firing pin:
slip spring over the nail, insert into the firing pin channel (be careful when cleaning up firing pin chanel with drill if you have too, very easy to drill too deep and need a longer spring)
locks into plate with M3 screw (you'll push the firing pin in some when inserting the retaining screw, it goes between the 2 disks on the nail)
grind the nail flush with the faceplate, then remove and grind to a dull point.

optional nut weights on rear:
for larger nuts you need to grind the top side where its flush with the bolt carrier so it fits in the upper, I do receomend using the larger nut and I used a marker to mark where the curve of the carrier is, put nut in vice, then grinded the corners where it needed it
I suggest using them, and mfor testing mine had 2 (one large close to the bolt carrier and a second behind it for extra weight for testing then I was planning to remove and find minimuum safe weight, but I do suggest having the bolt mass the same as the original and for some versions of the Mod9 you can increase the top bolt length if desired.

-This mag release principal is Derwoods idea for trancparancy.

-Dimensions in freedom units are provided.
 2 countries and coutning,  we're bringing it back.

-Has only been lightly tested @ 30 rounds of live fire due to these trying times
 May need slight tweaking but this will get you 95% of the way there
 
-Used coathanger for spring reaction bar, and mag catch. My coathanger was .089" dia.
 Use lighter to heat up wires and insert into holes for size.
 Mag catch cut to .66", its not critical as long as it will insert into the mag catch
 Reaction bar is cut flush with top of magwell body

-Use 7/16" dia, .046 "wire ga spring cut to .77" for release. Whatever gives you
 the tension you want. That's what worked for me. Feel free to edit the files
 to fit whatever you have handy that gives you the warm and fuzzies.

-Much love to all the guys in the weightforward keybase. Y'all are total gems

-Your wife misses you

-Go straight home, don't talk to any strangers
